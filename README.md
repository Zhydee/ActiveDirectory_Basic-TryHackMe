<h2>üß† TryHackMe ‚Äì Active Directory Basics</h2>

<p>This repository contains my personal notes and summaries from the <strong>"Active Directory Basics"</strong> room on TryHackMe. The room provides hands-on experience with essential AD concepts used in real-world enterprise environments.</p>

<h3>üîç Topics I Covered:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Organizational Units (OUs):</strong> Understanding how to structure and organize users, groups, and computers within Active Directory.</li>
  <li><strong>User Management:</strong> Creating, deleting, and managing users, including using <strong>delegation</strong> to grant specific administrative privileges without giving full control.</li>
  <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Adding and managing computer objects inside the domain, and understanding how AD tracks and authenticates devices.</li>
  <li><strong>Group Policy Objects (GPO):</strong> Implementing and applying GPOs to control system configurations and enforce security settings across the domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>This lab helped reinforce foundational knowledge for roles like SOC analyst, system administrator, and blue team operations.</p>

<br />
<br />
  
<h2>Managing Users in Active Directory:</h2>
<h3>Deleting OU:</h3>
<p>For this part, I will delete OU called Research and Development since the department has been closed in the scenario.</p>
<p align="center">
Enable advanced features:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZE8cALN.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Right click OU and go to properties. Under Object tab, untick "Protect object from accidental deletion":  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/uVVyNdt.png" height="80%" width="50%" alt="AD"/>
<br />

<br />
<br />
</p>
<h3>Grant User Specific Privileges (Delegate Control):</h3>
<p>For this part, I will grant a specific privilege to Phillip since he is the leader of his department.</p>
<p align="center">
Right click OU & choose delegate control:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/HbzvvsC.png" height="80%" width="50%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Enter user name, and click check names:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Confirmed presence of the user in OU & click OK:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UG9eA94.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ho5Sn0w.png" height="80%" width="50%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<p>Now, Phillip should be able to reset passwords for any user in the sales department</p>

<h2>Organizing Devices:</h2>
<p align="center">
  <p>For this part, all laptop and pc will be move to OU called workstation, while all server move to OU called servers. This is because having all of the devices in one OU is not the best idea since it's very likely that we want different policies for our servers and the machines that regular users use on a daily basis.</p>
  <p align="center">
At the start, all devices in OU called Computers:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/FXB84rS.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Create OU called Workstations: <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0n0HK1q.png" height="80%" width="50%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Create OU called Servers: <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/qQZyK6Q.png" height="80%" width="50%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Result for Workstations:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4njabnf.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Result for Servers:  <br/>

<br />

<h2>Group Policies:</h2>
<h3>Edit Group Policy:</h3>
<p align="center">
  <p>For this part, I will modify the existing group policy called Default Domain Policy</p>
  <p align="center">
Launch group policy management:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hLX784y.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Click on the group policy and go to Setting tab:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/q7WX3t6.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Right click the GPO & choose edit:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ErWUFxy.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
In this scenario, I will change the highlighted policy value:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RrZmyZk.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Change the policy value from 7 to 10:  <br/>

<br />
<h3>Create New Group Policy(Restrict Control Panel Access):</h3>
<p> I will create a new policy called Restrict Control Panel Access for this part. Implementing this GPO allow us to block non-IT users from accessing the Control Panel</p>
<p align="center">
Create new GPO & named it Restrict Control Panel Access:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3hyzg68.png" height="80%" width="50%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
Open the GPO for editing:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Navigate to policies->Administrative Template->Control Panel.  Double click "Prohibit access to Control Panel and PC settings:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/X3SpLqI.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
To link the created GPO to OU, drag it to all of the OU corresponding to users who shouldn't have access to the Control Panel of their PCs, which are Marketing, Management and Sales & Clikc OK<br/>

<br />
<h3>Create New Group Policy(Auto Lock Screen):</h3>
<p align="center">
  <p>For this part, I will create a GPO with the inactivity limit set to 5 minutes so that computers get locked automatically if any user leaves their session open and put it under the Root Domain to apply it to all current and future devices </p>
  <p align="center">
Create a new GPO and name it Auto Lock Screen:  <br/>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RA4pE2f.png" height="80%" width="50%" alt="AD"/>
<br />
<br />
Click edit on the GPO and when GPO editor opens, navigate to Policies->Windows Settings->Security Settings->Security Options. Double click Interactive logon: Machine inactive limit<br/>

<h2 id="conclusion">üìå Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Completing the <strong>Active Directory Basics</strong> lab on TryHackMe has deepened my understanding of core AD administration tasks, including how to structure OU, manage users and devices, apply group policies, and delegate administrative responsibilities. These are not just academic concepts but critical skills that align with real-world enterprise environments, especially in SOC, sysadmin, and blue team operations.
</p>
<p>
By applying theoretical knowledge in a hands-on environment, I‚Äôve gained practical experience that will help me respond effectively in scenarios involving account management, system hardening, and privilege delegation. This lab has solidified my foundation in AD and motivates me to explore more advanced topics such as Kerberos authentication, AD enumeration, and domain privilege escalation.
